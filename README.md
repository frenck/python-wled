Asynchronous Python client for WLED.

## About

This package allows you to control and monitor an WLED device
programmatically. It is mainly created to allow third-party programs to automate
the behavior of WLED.

## Installation

```bash
pip install wled
```

## Usage

```python
import asyncio

from wled import WLED


async def main(loop):
    """Show example on controlling your WLED device."""
    async with WLED("wled-frenck.local", loop=loop) as led:
        device = await led.update()
        print(device.info.version)

        # Turn strip on, full brightness
        await led.light(on=True, brightness=255)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main(loop))
```

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on
[Keep a Changelog][keepchangelog].

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- ``MAJOR``: Incompatible or major changes.
- ``MINOR``: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.
- ``PATCH``: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

In case you'd like to contribute, a `Makefile` has been included to ensure a
quick start.

```bash
make venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
make dev
```

Now you can start developing, run `make` without arguments to get an overview
of all make goals that are available (including description):

```bash
$ make
Asynchronous Python client for WLED.

Usage:
  make help                            Shows this message.
